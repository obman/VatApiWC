## Settings

### API Type

Choose the geocoding API that best suits your needs.
Different APIs offer varying data and accuracy levels.  
We recommend trying each one to find the optimal fit for your store.

*Note: Currently  are 3 types of geocode API available.*

### API Method: Address to ZIP and City name or ZIP to City name

Select the desired geocoding method:

* **Address to ZIP/Postcode and City:** Check this box to automatically fill both city and ZIP/postal code based on the entered address.
* **ZIP/Postcode to City:** Leave unchecked if you only want to fill the city based on the ZIP/postal code.

*Note: Currently only API type 1 offers both options.*

### API Method: Get multiple address based on input address

This method will provide multiple address names with uncomplete address input.

*Note: Currently works only with API type 3.*

### Fields IDs

Enter the IDs of your input fields.

By default, the plugin populates the IDs of the standard WooCommerce checkout form fields.
If you're using custom checkout elements, enter their respective IDs here.

**Here's how to find field IDs:**

1. Access your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Appearance > Widgets.
3. Add the "Custom HTML" widget to a sidebar.
4. Paste the following code into the widget content area:
```html
<script>
    console.log(document.getElementById('billing_company').id);
    console.log(document.getElementById('billing_vat_number').id);
  console.log(document.getElementById('billing_postcode').id);
  console.log(document.getElementById('billing_city').id);
</script>
```
5. Save the widget.
6. Visit your checkout page and open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12). 
7. Look for the logged IDs in the console. These are the IDs you need to enter in the plugin settings.

**Remember to remove the "Custom HTML" widget afterward.**
